ABeginner'sRideOnMakingHisOwnGames

I always wanted to learn how to program, till three years ago I had an idea about a new game which was really a knock-out version of a super poplular game made me worked on it on and off along the way and finally get to the point where I decide i should just learn to make it myself giving the actualluy boardgame been almost set and now it's time for rock it on a computer of a phone. Found myself mumbled so much here and want to make a change through this, I'm having a good feeling about this! 

I plan to use Godot to make my game, and I heard Python is very similar to what Godot use as a code language, I'm willing to learn more.
